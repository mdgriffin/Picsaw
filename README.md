# OOP2 Project - Image Jigsaw puzzle game

Project built for the OOP2 module of my software development course.

Build with Java using Swing for the GUI. Allows the user to play a simple Image Jigsaw game. Images are divided into block. Blocks can be rearranged by dragging and dropping them into their desired positions until all blocks are in the correct position, at which point the game is won.
